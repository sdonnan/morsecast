This site hosts podcast feeds that automatically convert news articles from
[The Conversation](https://theconversation.com) into Morse code. This source
was chosen due the permissive Creative Commons licensing of its content.
Updates should happen daily to the feeds.

Articles are currently truncated based on a heuristic to keep the duration of
the audio file reasonable for slower WPMs.

Note that this Morse generator can set the overall WPM for the file and a
different WPM for characters. This is desirable so that characters can be
learned at full speed while still having an approachable overall pace.

The following table lists the available feeds. If you would like request a
different speed or feed from The Conversation please contact me at: w4stu at
arrl dot net.
