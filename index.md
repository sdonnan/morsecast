This site hosts podcast feeds that contain news articles that have been
converted into Morse code. It is intended to be a learning aid by providing
useful practice material in a convenient manner.

Source material is [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com). This source
was chosen due the permissive Creative Commons licensing of its content.
Articles are currently truncated based on a heuristic to keep the duration of
the audio file reasonable for slower WPMs.

Note that this Morse generator can set the overall speed (in words per minute,
WPM) for the file and a different speed for characters. This is desirable so
that characters can be learned at full speed while still having an approachable
overall pace.

The following table lists the available feeds. Others available upon request. A
good method for requesting other speeds would be to open an issue on
[Github](https://github.com/sdonnan/morsecasts).
