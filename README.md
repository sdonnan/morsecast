Morsecast
=========

This project was developed so I could learn morse code. It has two scripts:

* `mkmorse.py` which turns text into morse code audio files
* `update.py` which converts a newsfeed into a morse audio podcast

Everything works, but the project is poorly organized right now.

All code is MIT licensed.
